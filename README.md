# Don't say to do it, just do it.
_This site is inspired by the [Don't ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)._

Are you tired of coworkers talking about what we should do, and never actually doing anything?
Are you fed up with endless discussions that lead nowhere?
Instead of them doing their job, they just talk about it until you do it for them?

Just send them here, and they will see that they should just do it instead of talking about it.

# Example

```conversation
Dude, who has not contributed anything in the last 3 weeks:

Dude: Hey hab bisshen mit paar aus anderen Gruppen gesprochen und denke das wir am besten so viele davon implementieren sollten:
Dude: - Feature 1
Dude: - Feature 2 (Huge rework)
Dude: - Feature 3
Dude: - Feature 4 (Complete reverse of the current architecture)

Dude: Ich persönlich denke das 2, 4 am wichtigsten sind.

Competent Coworker: Das wär sehr viel Arbeit, in sehr kurzer Zeit.

Dude: Und die anderen Features, sind echt kein Problem, die können wir schnell angehen.

Competent Coworker: Ja, aber allein Feature 2 hat schon viele Side-Effects.

[Team]: Starts to work on essential features.
Dude: Ghosts for 5 days.

```conversation
Dude, who has not contributed anything in the last 4 weeks, 3 days before the deadline:

Dude: Hey, we should really rework the whole UI, I think it would be great if we could do it like this: ...

...

Dude: Vanishes for a day.
```

```conversation
Dude in private chat to Competent Coworker, 1.8 days before the deadline:
Dude: Hey, I think we should really do this feature, are you up to do an All-nighter with me, like a bootcamp?

Competent Coworker: Dude, Im currently really busy with the current tasks, I can't do it.

Dude: But we really need this feature, I think it would be great if we could do it like this: ...
...
Next day:
...

Dude: You finished the feature? I think it would be great if we could do it tonight, bootcamp style, so we can finish it in time.

Competent Coworker: Dude, there is no time to test it, we cannot just implement it like that, we need to test it first.
...

In the end, Competent Coworker and the rest of the team fixed 57 bugs, and added 3 features, while Dude did not contribute anything meaningful in the last 5 weeks.
