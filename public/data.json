We can knock those out super quickly.\n\n**Competent Coworker:** But Feature 2 alone has massive side effects across the entire codebase...\n\n*[Team starts working on actually essential features]*\n\n**Dude:** *Vanishes into the digital void for 5 days* ðŸ‘»"

There's literally no bandwidth for new features.\n\n**Dude:** But this feature could be a game-changer! Just imagine if we could...\n\n*[24 hours later]*\n\n**Dude:** So, did you finish that thing? Because I was thinking we could do another all-nighter tonight and really push this feature through!\n\n**Competent Coworker:** There's no time for testing. We can't just throw untested code into production hours before deadline.\n\n**Dude:** Come on, live a little! What's the worst that could happen?\n\n---\n\n**Final Score:**\n- **The Team:** Fixed 57 critical bugs, implemented 3 essential features\n- **Dude:** Contributed exactly zero meaningful code in 5 weeks\n- **Dude's Confidence Level:** Somehow still at 100% ðŸ“ˆ"
